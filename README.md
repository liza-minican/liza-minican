## Hey! I am Liza! 
## I am an inspired Frontend Developer 👩‍💻 

After  working in Maketing, Project Management and trying out some entrepreneurial endeavours, I've realized that to be happy at work I need:
* *to constantly learn something new*
* *to solve problems*
* *creativity*
* *tangible immediate results*
* *collaboration and team work*
* *supportive community* 

I was always curious about programming and finally I decided to give it a go and enrolled in a coding bootcamp Technigo, and it turned out that programming requires exactly the right combination of things that make me happy at work. This intense and demanding program has opened up the exciting world of developing for me and i am very happy that I am a part of it now!!
I find it extremely satisfying when all the work results in a beautiful, functional product.

Here in my Github you can see my projects that were done during the bootcamp, please don't be misled by the fact that they are forked from Technigo's repositories. You can follow to the master repository and see that they are just templates and some instructions for the projects. 
The progects are work in progress and I'll update them everytime I find a better solution. Moreover, I'll add new ones when finished working on them.

You can contact me here if you'd like to learn more about my progress:📧 liza.minican@gmail.com
