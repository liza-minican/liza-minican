#Hey! I am Liza! 
I worked in Maketing, Project Management before and tried out some entrepreneurial projects. 
That was fun, but when I discovered programming I quickly realized that it is like all in one for me. It inncludes:
* Constant learning and improving
* Supportive community with a lot of recources
* Tangible results
